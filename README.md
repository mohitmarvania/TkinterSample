This is the sample of python module Tkinter and many other like (OpenCV, pyttsx3, etc.)


* The program contains an sample tkinter gui. * The GUI is having 3 options, which are:
   1.) **Camera**
   2.) **Calculator**
   3.) **AudioBook** (Which is not implemented for now)
* By clicking on the camera button the camera will be opened. The camera can be closed only by pressing 'Q' key from the keyboard.
* On clicking on the calculator the sperate GUI of calculator will be opened which will have and interface of the calculator. The operation in 
   the calculator can be performed with the help of keyboard also.(Clicking on multiple times on 'calculator' button will open multiple calculator
   GUI's)
